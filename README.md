# Supermarket Sales

This project is currently under development, but in it's state it shows data visulizations by utilizing ggplot2 and plotly. By utilizing these tools along with other libraries in RStudio, I have created interactive graphs. By hovering over the graphs we can see details such as the membership status, product type, gender, time and more with their effects on sales.

# Future Updates

In the future I will be updating this to also include statistical analysis such as linear and logistical regression to explain target varibles along with a detailed analysis to show my findings.
